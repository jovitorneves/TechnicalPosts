## Articles

### 1. [SOLID](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitorneves0_solid-swift-activity-7245537945955274756-dEO3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
- **Description**: SOLID is a set of five principles that guide us in writing better, more maintainable code in Swift. The Single Responsibility Principle means each class should focus on a single task. The Open/Closed Principle encourages us to create classes that can be extended without modifying existing code. The Liskov Substitution Principle ensures that subclasses can replace their parent classes without issues. The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that we should create smaller, more specific interfaces so clients only depend on what they need. Lastly, the Dependency Inversion Principle promotes the idea that high-level modules should rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. Following these principles helps make our code cleaner and easier to work with over time.

### 2. [Clean Swift](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitorneves0_clean-swift-activity-7245059629922078720-OVTo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
- **Description**: Clear Swift is a design approach that helps us write clean, maintainable, and testable code in Swift applications. It emphasizes separating concerns by organizing our code into distinct layers, which makes it easier to manage and understand. In Clear Swift, we typically break down our applications into components like Views, Interactors, Presenters, and Routers. Each component has a specific responsibility: Views handle the user interface, Interactors manage business logic, Presenters format data for display, and Routers handle navigation. This clear separation not only simplifies collaboration among team members but also makes it easier to test individual parts of the application. By following the Clear Swift architecture, we can create apps that are robust, scalable, and easier to maintain in the long run.

### 3. [Weak Self](https://medium.com/@jo_vitorneves/understanding-weak-self-in-swift-memory-leaks-explained-e21fb643327a)
- **Description**: In Swift, using weak self is a crucial practice for managing memory effectively, especially in situations involving closures. When we capture a reference to self inside a closure, it can create a strong reference cycle, leading to memory leaks because the closure and self hold strong references to each other. By declaring self as weak within the closure, we prevent this cycle. This means that if self is deallocated, the closure wonâ€™t hold on to it, allowing for proper memory management. Using weak self helps keep our apps running smoothly and efficiently, ensuring that objects are released from memory when they are no longer needed, thus avoiding unnecessary resource consumption.

### 4. [Combine](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/como-usar-combine-swift-para-melhorar-programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-em-jo%C3%A3o-vitor-xufnf/?trackingId=jv5QUccsQ1mFLXJ4QoUCmg%3D%3D)
- **Description**: Combine is a powerful framework in Swift that allows us to work with asynchronous data streams in a declarative way. It simplifies handling events over time, such as user interactions or network responses, by using publishers and subscribers. With Combine, we can chain together operations like mapping, filtering, and merging data streams, which makes our code cleaner and more concise. The framework promotes a reactive programming style, allowing us to respond to changes in data automatically. This approach not only helps manage complex asynchronous tasks more effectively but also enhances code readability and maintainability. By leveraging Combine, we can create responsive and efficient applications that handle data flow seamlessly.
